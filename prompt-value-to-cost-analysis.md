# Prompt: Value to Cost Analysis for Product Prioritization

## Context
I need to prioritize features by comparing their value delivery against implementation costs. Help me identify features that deliver maximum value per dollar invested.

## Product Information
**Product**: [Your product]
**Features to Evaluate**: [List features]
**Budget**: [Available resources]
**Timeline**: [Planning period]

## Cost Estimation

For each feature, estimate total cost of ownership:

**Development Costs**
- Engineering effort (person-weeks × hourly rate)
- Design and UX work
- Product management overhead
- QA and testing effort
- Technical debt incurred
- **Total Development Cost**: $[amount]

**Infrastructure Costs**
- Initial setup and configuration
- Ongoing hosting and cloud services
- Third-party APIs or services
- Monitoring and observability tools
- Data storage and processing
- **Monthly/Annual Infrastructure Cost**: $[amount]

**Operational Costs**
- Documentation creation
- Training materials and sales enablement
- Support team training and increased ticket volume
- Customer success touch points
- Marketing and promotion
- **Ongoing Operational Cost**: $[amount per period]

**Opportunity Costs**
- What else could team build instead?
- Value of alternative features foregone
- Market opportunity timing costs

**Total Cost Over Time Horizon**: Sum of all costs over evaluation period

## Value Quantification

For each feature, estimate measurable value:

**Revenue Value**
- New customers acquired × ARPU
- Conversion rate improvement × funnel volume
- Upsell opportunity × existing customer base
- Churn reduction × saved revenue
- Premium pricing uplift
- **Total Revenue Impact**: $[amount over time horizon]

**Cost Savings Value**
- Support ticket reduction × cost per ticket
- Manual process automation × labor cost
- Infrastructure optimization savings
- Operational efficiency gains
- **Total Cost Savings**: $[amount over time horizon]

**Strategic Value** (qualitative, but attempt quantification)
- Market positioning value
- Competitive defense value
- Platform/ecosystem effects
- Brand value enhancement
- **Estimated Strategic Value**: $[amount or qualitative rating]

**Total Value**: Sum of all value components

## Value-to-Cost Ratio

Calculate for each feature:
- **VTC Ratio** = Total Value / Total Cost
- Higher ratio = better return on investment
- Target minimum ratio: [e.g., 3:1, 5:1]

## Efficiency Frontier Analysis

Identify features that maximize value for given cost:
- Plot features on Value vs Cost chart
- Identify efficient frontier (best value at each cost level)
- Flag features below efficient frontier as poor investments
- Consider portfolio approach balancing quick wins with big bets

## Marginal Value Analysis

For features with variable scope:
- What is MVP version cost and value?
- What is incremental cost and value of enhancements?
- Identify diminishing returns points
- Recommend scope that maximizes VTC ratio

## Budget Allocation Scenarios

Model different budget scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Limited Budget** ($[amount])
- Which features maximize value within constraint?
- What is total value delivered?
- What value is left on table?

**Scenario 2: Target Budget** ($[amount])
- Optimal portfolio of features
- Expected value delivery
- Risk diversification

**Scenario 3: Expanded Budget** ($[amount])
- Marginal features added
- Incremental value vs incremental cost
- Point of diminishing returns

## Requested Output

Provide analysis including:

**Executive Summary**
- Top features by value-to-cost ratio
- Recommended portfolio within budget
- Expected value delivery

**Feature Comparison Table**
| Feature | Development Cost | Ongoing Cost | Total Cost | Value | VTC Ratio | Priority |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|------------|-------|-----------|----------|

**Value vs Cost Visualization**
Plot showing feature positions and efficient frontier

**Budget Allocation Recommendation**
Specific features to fund at different budget levels with expected outcomes

**Sensitivity Analysis**
Impact of cost or value estimate changes on prioritization

## Additional Context
- **Cost Assumptions**: [Labor rates, infrastructure costs, etc.]
- **Value Assumptions**: [Customer acquisition, conversion rates, etc.]
- **Time Horizon**: [Period for value and cost calculations]
- **Budget Constraints**: [Hard limits or flexible targets]
