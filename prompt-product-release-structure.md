## Prompt Template

I need to develop a comprehensive product release strategy for my AI product. Help me think through all aspects of bringing this product to market, from alpha testing through general availability and beyond. I want to ensure we have the right phasing, success criteria, operational readiness, and go-to-market execution.

### Product Release Context
**Product Name and Description**: [What are we launching?]
**Target Launch Timeline**: [When do we aim to have this in market?]
**Current Development Stage**: [Where are we today in the development process?]
**Target Market and Customers**: [Who are the initial target users?]
**Strategic Importance**: [How critical is this launch to overall business strategy?]

### Release Strategy Framework

**Release Phase Definition and Sequencing**

Help me structure a phased approach to releasing this product that balances speed to market with quality and learning. The goal is to start small with friendly users who can help us refine the product, then gradually expand to broader audiences as we validate product-market fit and operational readiness.

For the alpha or early preview phase, what should the scope and objectives be? Typically alpha is about validating core functionality with internal users and friendly customers who understand they're working with something unfinished. Who should have access during this phase? What are we specifically trying to learn? What level of reliability and polish is acceptable at this stage? What success criteria determine whether we're ready to move to beta?

The beta or limited availability phase represents a significant expansion of users but still maintains some constraints on who can access the product. Private beta might involve hundreds to thousands of selected users, while public beta opens to anyone who signs up. What constraints do we maintain during beta? Are there usage limits, feature restrictions, or support limitations? How do we select beta participants to ensure we get diverse perspectives? What feedback mechanisms and communication channels do we establish? What is our support model during beta? What metrics and feedback will tell us we're ready for general availability?

The general availability or full launch phase means the product is ready for any customer in our target market. What does production readiness look like across all dimensions including technical reliability, feature completeness, documentation, support capacity, sales enablement, and operational processes? How do we phase the rollout even within GA to manage risk and load? What is our rollback plan if we discover critical issues?

Post-launch optimization and iteration continues indefinitely after initial release. How do we maintain development velocity while supporting a live product? What is our cadence for updates and new feature releases? How do we balance innovation with stability? What processes ensure we're continuously learning from usage data and customer feedback?

**Success Criteria and Decision Gates**

For each release phase, we need clear success criteria that determine whether we proceed to the next phase or pause to address issues. Help me define these decision gates.

What technical performance metrics must we achieve before expanding access? Consider system reliability and uptime, response time and latency, error rates and handling, scalability under load, and data quality metrics. What are the specific thresholds for each? How do we measure them reliably? Who makes the go or no-go decision?

User experience and satisfaction metrics provide crucial validation of product-market fit. What does good look like for user activation and onboarding success, feature adoption and usage patterns, user satisfaction scores like NPS or CSAT, qualitative feedback themes, and task completion rates? How do we balance quantitative metrics with qualitative insights? What level of user satisfaction is acceptable for each phase?

Business impact metrics validate that the product delivers value. What should we see in terms of customer acquisition and conversion rates, revenue or usage growth, customer retention and churn, time to value for new customers, and return on investment compared to development costs? Some of these metrics may take time to materialize, so what early indicators help us predict business success?

AI-specific success criteria reflect the quality and reliability of the AI components. What model performance metrics matter most for our use case? How do we measure the quality of AI outputs from the user's perspective? What percentage of queries should the AI handle successfully versus requiring fallback? How do we assess bias, fairness, and responsible AI dimensions? What level of explainability or transparency do we need to demonstrate?

**Operational Readiness and Infrastructure**

A successful launch requires readiness across all operational dimensions. Help me create a comprehensive readiness checklist and identify any gaps we need to address.

The technical infrastructure must handle anticipated load and maintain reliability. What is our estimated user base and usage patterns? How much headroom do we build into capacity planning? What is our monitoring and alerting infrastructure? How do we handle deployments and updates without disrupting users? What is our incident response process? How quickly can we rollback if needed? What redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities exist?

Customer support and success operations scale alongside the product. What support channels do we offer at each release phase? What are our response time commitments? What self-service resources and documentation exist? How are support staff trained on the product? What is the escalation path for complex issues? How do we capture and categorize support feedback to inform product improvements? What level of support is financially sustainable at different price points?

Sales and go-to-market readiness determines how effectively we can convert interest into customers. What sales materials and demo environments do we have? How are sales teams trained on the product positioning and competitive differentiation? What is the sales process and typical cycle time? What objection handling and competitive battle cards exist? How do we support proof of concept or trial processes? What pricing and packaging clarity do we have?

Documentation and enablement materials help users and internal teams alike. What end-user documentation exists including getting started guides, feature documentation, API references if applicable, and troubleshooting resources? What internal documentation covers system architecture, operational procedures, and institutional knowledge? What training materials help both customers and internal teams? How do we keep documentation current as the product evolves?

Compliance and security certifications may be required for enterprise adoption. What security standards must we meet like SOC 2, ISO 27001, or industry-specific requirements? What privacy regulations apply like GDPR or CCPA? What accessibility standards do we need to meet? What third-party audits or certifications should we complete before launch? What terms of service and data processing agreements are required?

**Launch Execution and Communication**

The launch itself requires careful orchestration across multiple workstreams. Help me develop a detailed launch plan that coordinates all the moving pieces.

The internal launch readiness ensures everyone in the company is prepared. How do we train customer-facing teams on positioning, features, and handling customer questions? What internal announcement and celebration recognizes the team's work? What escalation paths ensure rapid response to launch issues? How do we maintain team morale and energy during the intense launch period?

External communication and marketing drive awareness and adoption. What is our announcement strategy across different channels? How do we sequence press releases, blog posts, social media, and direct customer communication? What launch events or webinars introduce the product? How do we leverage partners, influencers, or industry analysts? What content marketing supports the launch? How do we build anticipation in the weeks leading up to launch?

Customer onboarding and activation focuses on getting users to their first value quickly. What is the ideal path from sign-up to first success? How do we guide users through this journey? What activation emails or in-product guidance exist? How do we measure and optimize the onboarding funnel? What intervention happens when users get stuck? How do we celebrate user milestones and successes?

Partnership and integration launches multiply our reach. What partner announcements coincide with our launch? What integrations are ready at launch versus coming soon? How do we support partners in their own marketing of the integration? What co-marketing opportunities exist? How do partners provide feedback into the product?

**Risk Management and Contingency Planning**

Things rarely go exactly as planned. Help me identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.

What are the technical risks that could derail the launch? These might include performance issues under load, critical bugs discovered late, infrastructure outages or reliability problems, security vulnerabilities, data quality or model performance issues, or integration failures with key third-party services. For each significant risk, what is our mitigation strategy? What monitoring and early warning systems detect problems quickly? What is our rollback or disaster recovery plan?

Market and competitive risks might change the landscape. What if a major competitor launches a similar product first? How do we respond to competitive moves that undercut our positioning? What if early customer feedback reveals we've misjudged product-market fit? What if a key partnership or integration falls through? For each scenario, what is our contingency plan?

Operational risks can strain the organization. What if we get far more demand than anticipated? What if support volume overwhelms our team? What if key team members become unavailable during critical launch periods? How do we maintain product development velocity while handling launch issues? What stress tests have we run on our operational processes?

Reputational risks require special attention for AI products. What if the AI produces harmful, biased, or embarrassing outputs? How do we handle potential misuse of the product? What is our incident response plan for responsible AI issues? How do we communicate about failures or limitations transparently? What processes limit exposure of problematic content or behaviors?

**Post-Launch Metrics and Optimization**

Success metrics shift after launch from "are we ready to launch" to "are we achieving our goals." Help me define the post-launch analytics and optimization approach.

The product analytics framework should track the full customer journey from acquisition through retention and expansion. What are our north star metrics that best indicate product success? What leading indicators predict these outcomes? How do we segment analytics by customer type, use case, or acquisition channel? What is our approach to experimentation and A/B testing? How quickly can we detect and respond to changes in key metrics?

Customer feedback loops ensure we continue learning and improving. What mechanisms capture both qualitative feedback and quantitative ratings? How do we prioritize and triage feedback? What processes ensure feedback flows back into product decisions? How do we close the loop with customers who provide feedback? What regular cadence exists for reviewing feedback themes with leadership?

AI model monitoring and improvement continues post-launch. What metrics track model performance in production? How do we detect model drift or degradation? What triggers model retraining or updates? How do we A/B test model improvements? What feedback loops exist between user interactions and model improvement? How do we balance model updates with stability?

Competitive intelligence and market sensing help us stay ahead. What signals do we monitor about competitive moves? How do we track customer win-loss rates and reasons? What market trends or technology shifts might impact our product? How do we incorporate competitive intelligence into roadmap decisions?

**Iteration and Enhancement Roadmap**

Help me think through the post-launch roadmap that builds on the initial release.

What features or improvements are planned for the first 30, 60, and 90 days post-launch? How do we balance fixing issues versus adding new capabilities? What feedback from early users most influences the roadmap? How do we communicate the roadmap to customers and manage their expectations?

The long-term product evolution extends beyond the initial launch. What major features or capabilities are in the longer-term vision? How does the product expand to serve new use cases or customer segments? What platform or ecosystem opportunities exist? How do we maintain strategic focus while being responsive to customer needs?

### Requested Output Format

Please structure your release strategy analysis as follows:

Provide an executive summary that captures the recommended phased approach, key milestones and timing, critical success factors, major risks and mitigation strategies, and resource requirements. This should give leadership a clear picture of the path to launch.

Detail the phase plan with specific definitions of alpha, beta, and GA phases including scope and objectives, user selection criteria, success criteria for each phase, duration and timing, key activities and deliverables, and decision gates between phases. Make this concrete enough that the team knows exactly what to do.

Create the operational readiness assessment with current state across all dimensions, gaps that need to be closed before launch, owners and timelines for closing gaps, dependencies and sequencing of readiness activities, and contingency plans for gaps that can't be fully closed. This becomes the launch checklist.

Develop the launch execution plan covering the final weeks before launch and first weeks after. Include specific tasks, owners, and timelines. Coordinate across product, engineering, marketing, sales, support, and any other relevant functions. Make it clear who does what when.

Define the success metrics and monitoring framework for each phase and post-launch. Specify not just what to measure but how to measure it, what good looks like, and who reviews the metrics regularly. Include both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment approaches.

Outline the risk matrix with identified risks, likelihood and impact assessment, mitigation strategies, contingency plans, and owners for each risk. Prioritize focus on the highest-impact risks.

Sketch the post-launch roadmap showing the evolution path from initial launch through the first six to twelve months. Connect this to customer feedback, market opportunities, and strategic objectives.

## Tips for Best Results

Start planning your launch strategy well before you think you need to. Many operational readiness activities take longer than expected, especially anything involving third parties like security certifications, legal agreements, or partner integrations. Building in buffer time reduces launch stress.

Involve all functions early in launch planning. Marketing, sales, support, legal, finance, and engineering all have requirements and dependencies that need to be understood and coordinated. Surprises late in the process create delays and quality compromises.

Test your launch plan with a tabletop exercise where the team walks through the plan looking for gaps, dependencies, and potential issues. This is much cheaper than discovering problems during the actual launch.

Remember that launch is just the beginning, not the end. Many products see their biggest improvements and growth in the months after launch as you learn from real usage. Plan for rapid iteration and continuous improvement rather than thinking of launch as a final destination.

Communicate progress and challenges transparently with stakeholders. Regular updates on readiness, metrics, and issues help build confidence and enable better decision-making. Leadership shouldn't be surprised by launch delays or issues.

Celebrate the launch with your team. Launching a product is a significant accomplishment that represents months or years of effort. Taking time to recognize the team's work builds morale and culture, especially important for the inevitable challenges ahead.
