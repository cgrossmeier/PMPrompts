# Prompt: New AI Product Development Framework

## Purpose
Use this prompt to guide the initial conceptualization and planning of a new AI-powered product. This framework helps identify opportunities, validate assumptions, and create a solid foundation for product development.

2. How are customers solving this problem today, and what are the pain points?
3. What is the economic value of solving this problem for our customers?
4. Who are the key stakeholders involved in purchasing and using this solution?
5. What would cause customers to switch from their current solution to ours?

**AI Product Fit**
1. Why is AI the right approach for this problem versus traditional software?
2. What type of AI/ML models are best suited for this use case?
3. What data requirements exist, and how will we access quality training data?
4. What are the accuracy and performance thresholds required for viability?
5. What are the explainability and transparency requirements for this domain?

**Technical Feasibility**
1. What is the current state of AI/ML technology for this application?
2. What are the key technical risks and uncertainties?
3. What infrastructure and computational resources are required?
4. What is the estimated time to develop a functional prototype?
5. What technical dependencies or third-party integrations are critical?

**Business Model and Economics**
1. What is our primary monetization strategy (subscription, usage-based, enterprise licensing)?
2. What are the unit economics and expected margins?
3. What are the customer acquisition costs and expected lifetime value?
4. What is the optimal pricing structure and why?
5. What are the key cost drivers (infrastructure, data, personnel)?

**Go-to-Market Strategy**
1. What is our ideal customer profile (ICP) for the first version?
2. What channels will we use to reach and acquire customers?
3. What is our positioning and key differentiation message?
4. What partnerships or integrations will accelerate adoption?
5. What is the expected sales cycle and buying process?

**Product Requirements**
1. What are the must-have features for the minimum viable product (MVP)?
2. What user experience principles are critical for success?
3. What integrations and interoperability are required?
4. What security, privacy, and compliance requirements exist?
5. What are the key success metrics we'll measure post-launch?

**Responsible AI Considerations**
1. What potential biases could exist in our training data or model outputs?
2. How will we ensure transparency and explainability for users?
3. What are the privacy implications, and how will we protect user data?
4. What safeguards are needed to prevent misuse or unintended consequences?
5. How will we handle errors, edge cases, and model failures gracefully?

**Competitive Positioning**
1. Who are our direct and indirect competitors?
2. What are our key differentiators versus existing solutions?
3. What is our defensibility strategy against future competition?
4. What could make this product obsolete, and how do we mitigate that risk?
5. What would the competitive response be to our entry?

**Risk Assessment**
1. What are the top technical risks and how do we mitigate them?
2. What market risks could derail adoption?
3. What regulatory or compliance risks exist?
4. What organizational or execution risks concern you?
5. What is the plan B if our primary hypothesis proves incorrect?

### Requested Output Format

Please provide your analysis in the following structure:

**Executive Summary** (2-3 paragraphs)
A concise overview of the opportunity, the proposed solution, and the key strategic recommendation.

**Market Analysis and Opportunity**
Comprehensive assessment of market size, trends, and competitive dynamics.

**Product Strategy and Positioning**
Clear articulation of the product vision, target customers, and differentiation strategy.

**Technical Approach and Feasibility**
Detailed plan for AI/ML implementation including model selection, data strategy, and technical architecture considerations.

**Business Model and Economics**
Financial projections, pricing strategy, and unit economics analysis.

**Go-to-Market Plan**
Customer acquisition strategy, channel selection, and launch timeline.

**Risk Assessment and Mitigation**
Identification of key risks across technical, market, and execution dimensions with specific mitigation strategies.

**Roadmap and Next Steps**
Phased approach with milestones, decision points, and resource requirements.

## Additional Context (Optional)

If you have specific information to share, add it here:
- **Existing Data or Research**: [Any market research, customer interviews, or competitive analysis already completed]
- **Technical Constraints**: [Any limitations on technology, infrastructure, or talent]
- **Strategic Constraints**: [Any company-specific considerations, budget limits, or timeline requirements]
- **Success Criteria**: [How will we define success for this product?]

## Follow-Up Questions to Ask After Initial Analysis

Once you receive the initial analysis, consider asking:

1. "What are the top three assumptions we need to validate first, and how should we test them?"
2. "Can you create a prioritized feature list with rationale for the MVP?"
3. "What would a 6-month roadmap look like with key milestones?"
4. "How should we structure the product team for this initiative?"
5. "What would cause us to pivot or abandon this opportunity?"
6. "Can you draft an executive presentation for stakeholder approval?"
7. "What metrics should we track during development and post-launch?"
8. "How do we protect this product from competitive threats?"

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: The more context you provide about your company, market, and constraints, the better the analysis
2. **Challenge Assumptions**: Ask Claude to play devil's advocate on your ideas
3. **Iterate**: Use the initial analysis as a starting point for deeper dives into specific areas
4. **Validate Externally**: Use Claude's analysis as a framework, but validate assumptions with real customers and data
5. **Document Decisions**: Keep track of key decisions and rationale for future reference

---

**Remember**: The goal isn't to have Claude make decisions for you, but to help you think through all the critical dimensions of launching a new AI product. Use this as a thinking partner to ensure you've considered all angles before committing significant resources.
