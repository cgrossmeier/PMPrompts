---

## Prompt Template

I need to develop a comprehensive B2B pricing and packaging strategy for my AI product. Help me think through all the dimensions of pricing including value-based pricing principles, packaging and tiering, pricing metrics, enterprise versus SMB approaches, and how to handle the unique challenges of AI product economics.

### Pricing Strategy Context
**Product Description**: [What does your AI product do, and what business value does it create?]
**Target Market Segments**: [Who are you selling to? SMB, mid-market, enterprise?]
**Competitive Landscape**: [How do competitors price similar offerings?]
**Cost Structure**: [What are your major costs including AI infrastructure, and how do they scale?]
**Business Model**: [SaaS subscription, usage-based, hybrid, or something else?]
**Current State**: [Do you have existing pricing, or are you starting from scratch?]

### Comprehensive Pricing Framework

**Value-Based Pricing Foundation**

Help me understand the value my product creates for customers and translate that into pricing that captures fair share of that value. The goal is pricing that feels reasonable to customers because it reflects real business outcomes while supporting healthy margins for sustainable business growth.

Begin by helping me articulate the business value our AI product creates. What specific business problems does it solve? How do we quantify the impact in terms that resonate with economic buyers? For example, does it reduce costs and if so which costs and by how much? Does it increase revenue and through what mechanisms? Does it improve efficiency and how does that translate to economic value? Does it reduce risk and what is that risk worth to the business? For AI products specifically, does it augment human capabilities allowing teams to accomplish more, make better decisions faster, or serve customers more effectively?

Understanding willingness to pay requires knowing what customers currently spend on alternatives or the status quo. If customers solve this problem manually today, what does that cost in terms of staff time, error rates, and opportunity cost? If they use competitive solutions, what do those cost? If they aren't solving the problem today, what pain does that create and what would they invest to eliminate it? This anchors expectations about pricing and helps ensure your price feels reasonable relative to alternatives.

The value metric that pricing builds on should align with how customers perceive value delivery. Some common value metrics include per user pricing which works when value scales with number of people using the product, usage-based pricing which ties cost to consumption of the service, tiered pricing based on feature access or usage thresholds, or outcome-based pricing tied to business results. For AI products, additional considerations arise around model usage, API calls, data processed, predictions generated, or accuracy improvements achieved. Help me identify the value metric that best aligns customer cost with value received.

The pricing psychology and anchoring affects how customers perceive value and fairness. What price points create natural anchors in this market? How do we frame pricing to emphasize value rather than cost? What comparison points help customers see the price as reasonable? How do we structure tiers to create clear differentiation and attractive upgrade paths? What decoy pricing or positioning makes our target tier seem like the obvious choice?

**Packaging and Tiering Strategy**

The way we package capabilities into tiers fundamentally shapes adoption and revenue. Help me design packages that serve different customer segments while creating natural expansion paths.

For a three-tier good-better-best structure, what belongs in each tier? The entry tier needs enough value to attract adoption but should leave room for expansion. What core capabilities are table stakes that must be in all tiers? What premium capabilities create clear differentiation for higher tiers? How do we gate features between tiers in ways that align with customer needs and willingness to pay? For AI products specifically, do we limit accuracy, performance, customization, explainability, or enterprise features across tiers?

Feature differentiation across tiers should be meaningful to customers and difficult for them to work around. What features do different customer segments most value? Which capabilities justify premium pricing? How do we prevent customers from getting stuck in lower tiers when they should upgrade? What usage patterns or milestones indicate readiness for the next tier? How do we design packaging so upgrade decisions feel natural rather than forced?

The packaging for different market segments may need to vary significantly. Small businesses prioritize simplicity and low initial cost. They value self-service, fast time to value, and month-to-month flexibility. Mid-market companies balance price sensitivity with more sophisticated needs. They want good capabilities without the overhead of enterprise contracts. Enterprise buyers require security, compliance, advanced features, and dedicated support. They expect custom contracting but are willing to pay substantially more. How does our packaging serve each segment appropriately?

The freemium versus free trial decision affects how users first experience value. Freemium provides ongoing free access with limited capabilities, great for viral adoption and product-led growth but can create large populations of users who never convert. Free trials give temporary full access, forcing conversion decisions but allowing users to experience complete value. Which model better serves our product and go-to-market strategy? For AI products, what limitations in the free tier still allow users to validate value without undermining paid tier value proposition?

**Pricing Models and Metrics**

The fundamental pricing model shapes everything from unit economics to how customers think about adoption. Help me select the right pricing model or combination of models for our business.

Subscription pricing provides predictable recurring revenue and works well for products that provide ongoing value. What should the subscription period be - monthly for flexibility or annual for predictability and lower churn? How do we incent annual commitments through pricing discounts or payment terms? What happens when customers want to downgrade or pause subscriptions? How do we handle proration and mid-cycle changes?

Usage-based pricing aligns cost with consumption, appealing to customers who want to pay only for what they use. This works well for AI products where inference costs scale with usage. What should the usage unit be - API calls, predictions, data processed, or something else? How do we set pricing per unit that covers costs and generates margin? What minimum commitments or overages structure prevents revenue unpredictability? How do we help customers predict their usage and costs? What happens if customers hit usage limits mid-cycle?

Hybrid pricing combines subscription and usage components, offering base capabilities for a subscription fee with additional usage charges. This balances revenue predictability with fair value alignment. What portion of value comes from subscription versus usage? How do we communicate the combined pricing model clearly? What usage is included in the base subscription? How do we structure overages or additional consumption? For AI products specifically, does the subscription cover the platform and usage charge for model inference?

Outcome-based or value-based pricing ties the price directly to business results achieved. This can be powerful but requires the ability to measure outcomes reliably and agreement on attribution. What outcomes can we measure and tie to pricing? How do we handle situations where outcomes depend partially on customer execution? What baseline or benchmark determines incremental value? How frequently do we assess outcomes and adjust pricing?

**Enterprise Pricing Considerations**

Enterprise deals require different approaches than self-serve SMB sales. Help me think through enterprise pricing dynamics and contracting.

The enterprise sales process involves longer cycles, multiple stakeholders, and custom negotiations. What is our starting list price that becomes the anchor for negotiations? How much discount authority do we give sales teams? What volume or commitment discounts make sense? How do we prevent race-to-the-bottom pricing while still closing strategic deals? What non-price concessions can we offer like custom terms, payment schedules, or service commitments?

Multi-year contracts balance customer commitment with pricing certainty. Should we offer price protection for multi-year deals? How much discount justifies a three-year versus one-year commitment? How do we handle renewals and price increases for customers on multi-year contracts? What escalators or true-ups account for growth during contract terms?

The enterprise platform pricing may require custom structuring. Do we offer unlimited user licenses at the enterprise level? How do we price platform capabilities versus individual products? What bundling makes sense across our portfolio? How do we balance simplicity of enterprise-wide deals with capturing value from different business units?

Security, compliance, and SLA requirements often command premium pricing at enterprise level. What security certifications or compliance standards do enterprise customers require? What SLA commitments do we make around uptime, performance, or support? How much premium do these guarantee-backed services command? What happens when we fail to meet SLAs - service credits, refunds, or other remedies?

**Pricing for AI-Specific Considerations**

AI products face unique pricing challenges around uncertainty, infrastructure costs, and value perception. Help me navigate these.

The cost structure for AI products includes significant infrastructure expenses that scale with usage. What are our actual costs for model inference, training, and data storage? How do infrastructure costs vary by user, use case, or usage volume? At what scale do infrastructure costs per user decrease? What is our target gross margin, and how does pricing need to work to achieve it? For models we license from third parties like foundation model APIs, how do we mark up those costs fairly?

The model performance and accuracy implications for pricing create interesting dynamics. Should customers pay more for higher accuracy models? Do we offer different model tiers with different performance levels? How do we communicate and guarantee performance levels? What happens when models don't meet customer expectations? For AI products that improve over time, do customers pay more as performance improves?

The transparency around AI costs helps customers understand pricing and avoid surprise bills. How do we help customers predict their costs? What calculators or estimation tools do we provide? How do we communicate overage charges or usage approaching limits? What controls let customers cap spending? How transparent should we be about our costs versus pure value-based pricing?

The pricing for customization and fine-tuning may need special handling. If customers can customize models with their data, what does that cost? Do we charge setup fees, ongoing fees, or both? How do we price the compute for training custom models? What happens to custom models when customers churn - do they retain access or lose it?

**Pricing Psychology and Communication**

How we present and communicate pricing affects customer perception and conversion. Help me design pricing presentation that maximizes conversions while setting clear expectations.

The pricing page design needs to be clear, compelling, and conversion-focused. What information belongs on the public pricing page versus behind a sales conversation? How do we present tiers to make the target tier seem like the obvious choice? What social proof like customer logos or testimonials reinforces pricing value? What calls to action drive next steps from pricing page visits? For AI products specifically, how do we address common concerns about reliability, accuracy, or vendor lock-in?

The pricing communication across the sales process must be consistent and clear. How do sales teams talk about pricing in initial conversations versus proposal stage? What ROI calculators or value quantification tools help justify pricing? How do we handle pricing objections or comparison to competitors? What case studies demonstrate value that justifies pricing?

The price increase strategy for existing customers requires care and communication. When and how do we increase prices? What grandfathering or protection do early customers receive? How much advance notice do we give? How do we communicate increases as justified by added value? What risks do increases create for churn, and how do we mitigate them?

**International and Market Expansion Pricing**

Pricing across different markets requires considering purchasing power parity, competitive dynamics, and operational complexity. Help me develop international pricing strategy.

The pricing localization decision determines whether we charge the same globally or adjust for markets. What is the case for uniform global pricing versus localized pricing? How do we prevent arbitrage if prices vary by market? What reference market do we use for setting baseline prices? How much do we adjust for purchasing power parity? What is minimal viable difference to justify the operational complexity?

Currency and payment considerations affect both user experience and our financial operations. What currencies do we support for payment? Do we absorb foreign exchange risk or pass it through? How do we handle international payment methods and taxes? What localization do we need in billing and invoicing?

**Pricing Experimentation and Optimization**

Pricing should evolve based on data and market feedback. Help me design a pricing optimization program that balances stability with continuous improvement.

The pricing experiments we can run include testing different price points, trying different packaging, evaluating new pricing models, or testing messaging and positioning. What hypotheses about pricing should we test? How do we design experiments that give clear signals without disrupting the business? What sample sizes and timeframes provide statistically significant results? How do we balance experimentation with the need for pricing consistency?

The pricing analytics and metrics help us understand whether pricing is working. What is our effective average selling price across segments and tiers? What are conversion rates at different price points? How often do customers upgrade versus downgrade? What is our net revenue retention? How does customer lifetime value vary by initial tier? What is the ratio of customers in each tier, and does it match our expectations?

**Pricing Governance and Process**

Pricing decisions affect the entire business and require governance. Help me establish clear ownership and process for pricing decisions.

The pricing authority determines who can make what decisions. Who owns the pricing strategy and can change list prices? What discount authority do sales teams have? What approvals are required for deals outside standard terms? How do we balance empowering sales with maintaining pricing discipline? What reporting makes pricing decisions visible to leadership?

The competitive pricing monitoring keeps us informed of market dynamics. What competitive pricing intelligence do we track? How often do we review competitor pricing? What signals trigger pricing response? How do we avoid reactive pricing that erodes margins while staying competitive?

## Tips for Best Results

Pricing is both art and science. Use data and analysis to inform pricing, but recognize that customer psychology, competitive dynamics, and strategic positioning also matter enormously. The best pricing balances multiple considerations rather than optimizing for a single factor.

Remember that pricing is not just about maximizing revenue but also about market positioning, customer acquisition, and long-term value creation. Sometimes lower pricing that accelerates adoption and builds network effects creates more value than higher pricing with slower growth.

Be very careful with price increases for existing customers. While necessary sometimes, they create churn risk and damage trust. If you must increase prices, provide significant advance notice, grandfather early customers when possible, and clearly communicate the added value justifying the increase.

Resist the temptation to discount your way to growth. Heavy discounting trains customers to expect discounts, commoditizes your offering, and erodes the perceived value of your product. Better to invest in articulating and delivering value than to race to the bottom on price.

For AI products specifically, be transparent about costs and performance. Customers appreciate honesty about the economic realities of AI infrastructure and are willing to pay fair prices for value, but they become frustrated by surprise bills or pricing that feels exploitative.

Test your pricing with real customers before committing fully. Run pilots with different pricing models, conduct willingness-to-pay studies, and iterate based on real market feedback. You can adjust pricing more easily before you have thousands of customers than after.

**Remember**: Pricing is one of the highest-leverage decisions you make as a product leader. A 10% pricing difference can easily represent 50% or more difference in profitability. Invest the time to get pricing right because the impact compounds over years as the business scales. Use this framework to develop pricing that captures fair value, supports your go-to-market strategy, and aligns with how customers perceive and receive value from your AI product.
