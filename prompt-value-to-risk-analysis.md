# Prompt: Value to Risk Analysis for Product Prioritization

## Context
I need to evaluate features by balancing their potential value against implementation and adoption risks. Help me create a systematic value-to-risk assessment that identifies high-value, low-risk opportunities.

## Product Information
**Product**: [Your product]
**Features to Evaluate**: [List features/initiatives]
**Risk Tolerance**: [Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive]
**Timeline**: [Planning horizon]

## Value Assessment

For each feature, quantify value across multiple dimensions:

**Customer Value**
- Problem severity this solves (1-10 scale)
- Number of customers affected
- Frequency of use once implemented
- Improvement over current solution
- Willingness to pay for this capability

**Business Value**
- Revenue impact (acquisition, expansion, retention)
- Market differentiation strength
- Strategic alignment with company vision
- Competitive positioning improvement
- Platform/ecosystem value creation

**Operational Value**
- Cost reduction or efficiency gains
- Support ticket reduction
- Automation of manual processes
- Scale enablement
- Technical debt reduction

**Total Value Score**: Weighted sum of all value dimensions (define weights based on company priorities)

## Risk Assessment

For each feature, evaluate risks across categories:

**Technical Risk**
- Technology maturity and proven track record
- Architectural complexity and dependencies
- Required expertise availability on team
- Integration challenges with existing systems
- Performance and scalability concerns
- **Score**: 1 (low risk) to 10 (high risk)

**Execution Risk**
- Team capacity and skill gaps
- Estimated effort accuracy and buffer
- Timeline certainty
- Third-party dependencies
- Organizational change required
- **Score**: 1 (low risk) to 10 (high risk)

**Market Risk**
- Customer adoption uncertainty
- Competitive response likelihood
- Market timing concerns
- Product-market fit confidence
- Regulatory or compliance issues
- **Score**: 1 (low risk) to 10 (high risk)

**Financial Risk**
- Cost overrun probability
- Revenue assumption confidence
- Investment size relative to budget
- Payback period uncertainty
- **Score**: 1 (low risk) to 10 (high risk)

**Total Risk Score**: Weighted average across risk categories

## Value-to-Risk Ratio

Calculate for each feature:
- **Value-to-Risk Ratio** = Total Value Score / Total Risk Score
- Higher ratio indicates more attractive opportunity
- Plot features on 2x2 matrix (Value vs Risk)

## Portfolio Balance

Categorize features into quadrants:

**Quick Wins** (High Value, Low Risk)
- Prioritize these first
- Fast execution, clear value
- Build momentum and confidence

**Big Bets** (High Value, High Risk)
- Strategic investments
- Require careful planning and de-risking
- Consider phased approach

**Fill Ins** (Low Value, Low Risk)
- Nice-to-haves for spare capacity
- Quick polish items
- Don't distract from priorities

**Money Pits** (Low Value, High Risk)
- Deprioritize or eliminate
- Not worth the risk
- Re-evaluate assumptions if stakeholder pressure exists

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

For high-risk, high-value features, develop mitigation plans:
- What discovery reduces uncertainty?
- What prototyping validates assumptions?
- What phasing reduces risk?
- What partners or expertise fills gaps?
- What monitoring provides early warnings?

## Requested Output

Provide comprehensive analysis including:

**Executive Summary**
- Top priority features based on value-to-risk ratio
- Portfolio balance assessment
- Key recommendations

**Feature Scorecards**
Detailed scoring for each feature with:
- Value breakdown by dimension
- Risk breakdown by category
- Value-to-risk ratio
- Quadrant classification
- Confidence level in assessments

**Value-to-Risk Matrix**
Visual plotting of all features showing relative positioning

**Risk Mitigation Plans**
For top features, specific actions to reduce risk

**Prioritized Roadmap**
Sequencing recommendation based on value-to-risk optimization

## Additional Context
- **Current Risk Exposure**: [Company's current risk portfolio]
- **Resource Constraints**: [Team capacity, budget limits]
- **Strategic Imperatives**: [Must-dos despite risk]
- **Stakeholder Input**: [Executive or customer priorities]
