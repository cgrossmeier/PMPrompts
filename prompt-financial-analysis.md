# Prompt: Financial Analysis for Product Feature Prioritization

## Context
I need to conduct a financial analysis to evaluate and prioritize product features or initiatives based on their economic impact. Help me build a comprehensive financial model that considers revenue potential, cost implications, and return on investment.

## Product Information
**Product Name**: [Your product]
**Features/Initiatives to Analyze**: [List the features or initiatives you're evaluating]
**Current Financial Metrics**: [ARR, MRR, customer count, ARPU, etc.]
**Time Horizon**: [Evaluation period - typically 12-36 months]

## Analysis Framework

### Revenue Impact Analysis
For each feature/initiative, help me estimate:

**Direct Revenue Impact**
- New customer acquisition driven by this feature
- Conversion rate improvement from free to paid tiers
- Expansion revenue from existing customers upgrading
- Reduction in churn and impact on retention
- Premium pricing potential enabled by this feature

**Indirect Revenue Impact**
- Market positioning and competitive advantage value
- Platform effects and network value creation
- Brand value and market perception improvements
- Partnership opportunities and ecosystem expansion

### Cost Analysis
For each feature/initiative, quantify:

**Development Costs**
- Engineering effort in person-months
- Design and research investment
- Technical infrastructure requirements
- Third-party services or licensing costs
- Opportunity cost of not building alternatives

**Ongoing Operational Costs**
- Infrastructure and hosting costs at scale
- Support and maintenance burden
- Sales enablement and training requirements
- Marketing and go-to-market expenses
- Customer success and onboarding costs

### Financial Metrics Calculation

Calculate and compare these metrics across all options:

**Net Present Value (NPV)**
- Project all future cash flows over evaluation period
- Apply appropriate discount rate (typically WACC)
- Calculate present value of investment

**Return on Investment (ROI)**
- ROI = (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment
- Express as percentage
- Compare against company hurdle rate

**Payback Period**
- Time required to recover initial investment
- Months until cumulative cash flow turns positive
- Preference for shorter payback periods

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
- Discount rate that makes NPV equal zero
- Compare against company cost of capital
- Higher IRR indicates more attractive investment

**Customer Lifetime Value Impact**
- Change in LTV from feature implementation
- LTV improvement × affected customer base
- Long-term value creation beyond payback period

### Sensitivity Analysis

Model different scenarios:
- Pessimistic case (conservative assumptions)
- Expected case (realistic assumptions)
- Optimistic case (aggressive assumptions)

Identify key assumptions that most impact outcomes and test their sensitivity.

### Risk-Adjusted Returns

Factor in probability of success:
- Technical execution risk
- Market adoption risk
- Competitive response risk
- Calculate expected value: (Outcome × Probability)

## Requested Output

Provide a financial analysis report including:

**Executive Summary**
- Top 3 features by financial attractiveness
- Expected financial impact over evaluation period
- Key recommendations and rationale

**Detailed Financial Models**
- Comprehensive model for each feature
- All assumptions clearly documented
- Monthly/quarterly cash flow projections
- Cumulative metrics over time horizon

**Comparative Analysis Table**
Feature comparison across all financial metrics in easy-to-scan format

**Sensitivity Analysis**

## Additional Context
- **Strategic Priorities**: [Company strategy that might influence prioritization]
- **Resource Constraints**: [Budget, team size, timeline limitations]
- **Market Conditions**: [Competitive dynamics, market trends]
- **Risk Tolerance**: [Company's appetite for risk vs. certainty]
