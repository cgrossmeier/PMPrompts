# Prompt: Buy a Feature Prioritization Exercise

## Context
I need to run a "Buy a Feature" exercise where customers or stakeholders allocate limited budget to purchase features. This reveals true priorities through forced trade-offs and constraints.

## Product Information
**Product**: [Your product]
**Features to Evaluate**: [List 10-20 features]
**Participants**: [Customer segments or internal stakeholders]
**Budget per Participant**: $[Typical amount like $100, $1000, etc.]

## Exercise Setup

**Feature Pricing Strategy**

Price each feature to reflect:
- Development effort/cost (normalized to budget scale)
- Strategic importance
- Market value

**Pricing Guidelines:**
- High complexity/value features: 30-50% of budget
- Medium complexity/value: 15-30% of budget
- Low complexity/value: 5-15% of budget
- Some features should require pooling across participants

**Feature List with Prices:**

| # | Feature Name | Description | Price | Rationale for Price |
|---|--------------|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| 1 | [Feature] | [Brief description] | $[amount] | [Why this price?] |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Running the Exercise

**Participant Instructions:**
"You have $[budget] to buy features for the product. Prices reflect development complexity and strategic value. You can:
- Buy individually if you have enough budget
- Pool money with others for expensive features
- Negotiate prices (±10% flexibility)
- Choose not to spend all your budget

Consider what would create most value for your use case."

**Facilitation Steps:**
1. Present all features with descriptions and prices
2. Give participants time to review and ask questions
3. Allow 20-30 minutes for purchasing decisions
4. Encourage collaboration for expensive features
5. Track all purchases and pooling
6. Facilitate discussion of trade-offs made

**Group Dynamics:**
- Run with 5-10 participants per session
- Mix customer types or stakeholder groups
- Allow social dynamics to reveal priorities
- Note which features spark debate

## Data Collection

**For Each Session, Track:**

**Feature Purchase Data:**
- How many participants bought each feature?
- Was pooling required or optional?
- Did feature sell out quickly or need persuasion?
- What percentage of total budget went to each feature?

**Participant Behavior:**
- What features did participants immediately want?
- What features were considered but rejected?
- What trade-offs were discussed?
- What unexpected insights emerged?

**Negotiation Patterns:**
- Which features triggered price negotiation?
- What features were deemed too expensive?
- What would participants pay more for?

## Analysis Framework

**Feature Demand Scoring:**

For each feature calculate:
- **Purchase Rate**: % of participants who bought it
- **Budget Allocation**: % of total budget spent on it
- **Pooling Requirement**: Did it require collaboration?
- **Discussion Volume**: How much debate did it create?

**Demand Categories:**

**Must-Haves** (>70% purchase rate, high budget share)
- Universal demand across segments
- Participants stretched budgets to include
- Often purchased first

**Strong Interest** (40-70% purchase rate)
- Clear value for many
- Segment-specific appeal
- Competitive trade-off decisions

**Nice-to-Haves** (10-40% purchase rate)
- Targeted appeal
- Lower priority
- Budget-dependent choices

**Low Interest** (<10% purchase rate)
- Questioned value
- Wrong pricing or description
- Possibly remove or reframe

**Segment Analysis:**
- Do different customer types prioritize differently?
- What patterns emerge by segment?
- What does this reveal about product-market fit?

**Pricing Insights:**
- Were prices perceived as fair?
- What would participants pay more/less for?
- Did any features appear under/overpriced?

## Requested Output

Provide comprehensive analysis:

**Executive Summary**
- Top 5 features by demand
- Key insights and surprises
- Strategic implications

**Feature Demand Report**
| Feature | Purchase Rate | Budget Share | Avg Price Paid | Demand Category | Notes |
|---------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|-------|

**Segment Analysis**
How priorities differ across customer types or stakeholder groups

**Prioritization Recommendations**
1. **Build Now** (High universal demand)
2. **Build Soon** (Strong segment demand)
3. **Reconsider** (Low interest or poor value perception)
4. **Reframe** (Good idea, wrong positioning)

**Qualitative Insights**
- Surprising trade-offs participants made
- Features that generated most discussion
- Pricing perception and willingness to pay
- Unmet needs or gaps participants noted

**Roadmap Implications**
How this exercise changes current roadmap priorities

## Variations

**Virtual Exercise:**
- Use online tools with virtual currency
- Async participation over several days
- Add feature voting or comments

**Multiple Rounds:**
- Round 1: Individual purchases
- Round 2: See others' choices, reallocate
- Reveals social proof effects

**Budget Variations:**
- Some participants get more budget (enterprise vs SMB)
- Tests pricing sensitivity across segments

## Additional Context
- **Current Roadmap**: [Existing priorities to validate/challenge]
- **Known Biases**: [Stakeholder agendas to watch for]
- **Strategic Questions**: [Specific hypotheses to test]
- **Follow-up Actions**: [How will results influence decisions?]
