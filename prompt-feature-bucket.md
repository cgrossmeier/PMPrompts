# Prompt: Feature Bucket Prioritization

## Context
I need to organize features into themed buckets that represent different strategic initiatives or product areas, then prioritize both the buckets and features within them.

## Product Information
**Product**: [Your product]
**Features to Organize**: [List features]
**Strategic Themes**: [Key focus areas]

## Bucket Definition

Define 5-8 strategic buckets that align with product strategy:

### Example Buckets:

**Bucket 1: [Theme Name, e.g., "New Customer Acquisition"]**
- **Objective**: [What this bucket aims to achieve]
- **Success Metrics**: [How success is measured]
- **Capacity Allocation**: [% of total resources]

**Bucket 2: [Theme Name, e.g., "Enterprise Expansion"]**
- **Objective**: [Goal]
- **Success Metrics**: [KPIs]
- **Capacity Allocation**: [%]

**Bucket 3: [Theme Name, e.g., "Product Experience & Polish"]**
- **Objective**: [Goal]
- **Success Metrics**: [KPIs]
- **Capacity Allocation**: [%]

**Bucket 4: [Theme Name, e.g., "Platform & Infrastructure"]**
- **Objective**: [Goal]
- **Success Metrics**: [KPIs]
- **Capacity Allocation**: [%]

**Bucket 5: [Theme Name, e.g., "AI/ML Capabilities"]**
- **Objective**: [Goal]
- **Success Metrics**: [KPIs]
- **Capacity Allocation**: [%]

## Bucket Prioritization

**Strategic Importance Ranking:**
Rank buckets by strategic priority (1 = highest):

| Rank | Bucket | Strategic Importance | Current State | Gap to Goal | Investment Level |
|------|--------|---------------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | [Bucket] | [Why important?] | [Where are we?] | [How far to go?] | High/Med/Low |

**Resource Allocation by Bucket:**
- High Priority Buckets: 30-40% each
- Medium Priority: 15-25% each
- Low Priority: 5-10% each
- Reserve/Buffer: 10%

## Feature Assignment

**Assign each feature to exactly one bucket:**

### Bucket 1: [Theme Name]
| Priority | Feature | Value | Effort | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | [Feature] | High | 3w | [Why this bucket?] |
| 2 | [Feature] | High | 5w | [Why priority 1 vs 2?] |

### Bucket 2: [Theme Name]
| Priority | Feature | Value | Effort | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|-----------|

[Repeat for all buckets]

## Within-Bucket Prioritization

For each bucket, rank features using:

**Value Scoring (1-10):**
- Contribution to bucket objective
- Impact on success metrics
- Customer/business value
- Strategic alignment

**Effort Scoring (1-10, lower = less effort):**
- Development time
- Complexity
- Risk
- Dependencies

**Priority = Value / Effort**

Top priority features within each bucket get resourced first

## Cross-Bucket Balance

**Portfolio Health Check:**

**Innovation vs. Maintenance**
- Growth features: __%
- Optimization features: __%
- Infrastructure/ops: __%
- Target ratios met? ✓/✗

**Time Horizon Mix**
- Quick wins (<1 month): __%
- Medium bets (1-3 months): __%
- Long-term investments (>3 months): __%

**Risk Distribution**
- Low risk: __%
- Medium risk: __%
- High risk: __%

**Customer Segment Coverage**
- SMB features: __%
- Mid-market features: __%
- Enterprise features: __%

## Requested Output

**Bucket Portfolio Overview**
| Bucket | Priority | Resource % | Feature Count | Total Effort | Key Objective |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------------|

**Detailed Bucket Breakdowns**
For each bucket:
- Objective and success metrics
- Prioritized feature list
- Resource allocation
- Timeline and milestones
- Dependencies
- Risks

**Roadmap by Bucket**
Timeline view showing when features from each bucket are executed:
```
Q1: [Bucket 1: Features], [Bucket 2: Features]...
Q2: [Bucket 1: Features], [Bucket 3: Features]...
Q3: [Bucket 2: Features], [Bucket 4: Features]...
Q4: [Bucket 5: Features], [Bucket 1: Features]...
```

**Portfolio Balance Analysis**
Assessment of whether bucket allocation aligns with strategy

**Bucket Health Metrics**
For each bucket:
- Capacity utilization
- Feature velocity
- Success metric trends
- Risks and mitigation

**Cross-Bucket Dependencies**
Features that span or depend across buckets

## Bucket Management

**When to Add New Bucket:**
- New strategic priority emerges
- Existing bucket becomes too broad
- Clear separation of concerns needed

**When to Sunset Bucket:**
- Strategic priority complete
- Objectives achieved
- Resources better used elsewhere

**When to Rebalance:**
- Quarterly planning
- Strategic pivots
- Market changes
- Performance data

## Sequencing Strategy

**Parallel Track Approach:**
Work on multiple buckets simultaneously:
- Maintain momentum across themes
- Diversify risk
- Serve different stakeholders

**Sequential Focus:**
Complete one bucket before starting next:
- Achieve meaningful progress
- Simpler coordination
- Clearer milestones

**Hybrid Approach:**
Primary focus (70%) + secondary focus (20%) + exploration (10%)

## Communication Framework

**Stakeholder Updates:**
Report progress by bucket:
- Bucket objective status
- Features completed
- Metrics movement
- Next priorities

**Team Organization:**
- Dedicated squads per bucket, or
- Shared resources across buckets
- Dependencies and handoffs

## Additional Context
- **Strategic Themes**: [Company priorities this quarter/year]
- **Team Structure**: [How teams are organized]
- **Market Dynamics**: [Competitive or timing factors]
- **Resource Constraints**: [Available capacity]
