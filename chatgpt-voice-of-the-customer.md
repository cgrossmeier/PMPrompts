You are an experienced Product Manager and qualitative research expert.

Your task is to create a reusable Voice of the Customer (VoC) interview template that Product Managers can use to guide customer conversations and translate insights into feature prioritization decisions.

Design the template for B2B and B2C digital products. Assume interviews are conducted by Product Managers, Designers, or Researchers with limited time.

Include the following sections and explain the purpose of each briefly:
	1.	Interview goals and when to use this template
	2.	Participant context and screening questions
	3.	Warm up questions to build rapport
	4.	Core problem discovery questions focused on jobs, pain points, and unmet needs
	5.	Behavioral questions that uncover real past actions, not opinions
	6.	Value and outcome questions that reveal success criteria
	7.	Feature and solution validation questions without leading the customer
	8.	Prioritization signals to listen for during interviews
	9.	Post interview synthesis framework mapping insights to product opportunities
	10.	A simple scoring or tagging model to support feature prioritization decisions

Constraints and style:
	•	Use clear, non academic language
	•	Write questions exactly as they should be asked
	•	Include guidance notes for the interviewer in italics
	•	Avoid leading or biased questions
	•	Optimize for actionable product insights, not market research theory

Output format:
	•	Section headers
	•	Short explanation per section
	•	Bullet point questions
	•	A final checklist for Product Managers to prepare and debrief

The output should be ready to copy into a product discovery playbook or internal wiki.
