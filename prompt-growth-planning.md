## Prompt Template

I need to develop a comprehensive growth strategy for my AI product. Help me think through all aspects of sustainable, scalable growth including customer acquisition, activation, retention, expansion, and the systems and capabilities we need to build to support this growth over time.

### Growth Strategy Context
**Product and Market**: [What is the product, and what market are we targeting?]
**Current State**: [Where are we today in terms of customers, revenue, and growth rate?]
**Growth Goals**: [What are our targets for the next 12-24 months?]
**Resources**: [What budget, team, and capabilities do we have for growth?]
**Business Model**: [How do we make money, and what are our unit economics?]

### Comprehensive Growth Framework

**Growth Model and Mechanics**

Help me understand the fundamental growth mechanics for our business and identify the highest-leverage opportunities for acceleration. Growth doesn't happen by accident but through systematic understanding of what drives new customer acquisition, how users become activated and valuable, what causes retention or churn, and how customers expand their usage and spending over time.

Begin by helping me map out our customer acquisition funnel. How do potential customers discover our product? This might include organic channels like search engine optimization, content marketing, and word of mouth, as well as paid channels like search ads, display advertising, social media marketing, or offline channels like events and partnerships. For each channel, what is the volume of awareness we're generating? What conversion rates exist from awareness to consideration to trial to purchase? Where are the biggest drop-offs in the funnel? What does customer acquisition cost look like across different channels?

The activation and onboarding process determines whether new users experience value quickly enough to stick around. What is the critical path from sign-up to first value? What does good activation look like, and what percentage of new users achieve it? How long does it typically take for users to activate? What are the common failure modes where users get stuck or frustrated? What interventions improve activation rates? For our AI product specifically, what do users need to understand about the capabilities and limitations to be successful? How do we set appropriate expectations and guide them to high-value use cases?

Understanding retention dynamics tells us whether we have sustainable product-market fit. What does our retention curve look like? How does cohort retention evolve over weeks and months? What distinguishes users who stick around from those who churn? What value do retained users extract from the product over time? For AI products, how does user confidence and trust in the AI evolve? Do users become more or less engaged as they understand the capabilities better? What drives long-term habit formation?

Revenue expansion from existing customers often represents the highest ROI growth opportunity. How do customers expand their usage over time? What triggers upgrades to higher pricing tiers? What additional features or capabilities drive expansion revenue? How does our land-and-expand strategy work in practice? What is net revenue retention, and how is it trending? What prevents customers from expanding, and how do we remove those barriers?

**Channel Strategy and Prioritization**

With finite resources, we must prioritize which growth channels to focus on. Help me evaluate potential growth channels systematically to identify where we should invest.

Consider product-led growth approaches where the product itself drives acquisition through viral mechanics, freemium conversion, or self-serve adoption. Does our product have natural viral loops where existing users invite others or create artifacts that attract new users? What is the viral coefficient, and how could we improve it? Does a freemium model make sense where users can experience value before paying? What is the conversion rate from free to paid, and what drives that conversion? Can users adopt our product without sales involvement, creating efficient self-serve growth?

Content marketing and SEO build long-term organic acquisition engines. What keywords and queries do our target customers search for when looking for solutions? What content can we create that ranks well and provides genuine value? How does our content strategy tie to the customer journey from awareness through consideration to purchase? What is our publishing velocity and distribution strategy? For AI products, what educational content helps users understand capabilities and successful implementation patterns?

Paid acquisition through advertising or sponsorships can accelerate growth if unit economics support it. What is customer lifetime value relative to acquisition cost across different channels? What paid channels have we tested, and what have we learned? Where can we find concentrations of our target audience with reasonable costs per click or impression? How quickly can we scale paid channels while maintaining acceptable CAC to LTV ratios? What creative or messaging variations perform best?

Partnerships and integrations multiply reach through existing audiences. What complementary products or platforms serve our target audience? What partnerships create mutual value through integration, co-marketing, or revenue sharing? How do we prioritize partnership opportunities based on audience fit and effort required? What is our approach to building and maintaining the partner ecosystem? For AI products, what data integrations or workflow embeddings create natural distribution?

Sales-driven growth through outbound prospecting and account-based marketing suits higher-value enterprise deals. What is our ideal customer profile for outbound sales? How do we identify and prioritize target accounts? What is the sales process and cycle time? How do marketing and sales collaborate on account-based approaches? What enablement and tools do sales teams need? What is sales capacity, and how does it scale?

Community and ecosystem development builds long-term moats through network effects. What community exists around our product or problem space? How do we foster user-generated content, peer support, and knowledge sharing? What role can power users and advocates play in growth? How do we cultivate and leverage community momentum? What events, forums, or platforms host our community?

**Growth Experimentation and Optimization**

Sustained growth requires systematic experimentation and optimization across the entire customer journey. Help me design a rigorous growth experimentation program.

The experimentation framework needs clear hypotheses, experiment design, success metrics, and learning capture. What process do we follow from identifying opportunities through designing experiments to analyzing results and implementing learnings? How do we prioritize experiments based on potential impact, confidence, and effort? What tools and infrastructure support rapid experimentation? How do we balance optimization of existing channels versus testing new opportunities?

For funnel optimization, what experiments can improve conversion at each stage? How do we test different value propositions, messaging, and creative? What pricing and packaging experiments might unlock growth? How do we optimize onboarding flows to increase activation? What personalization or segmentation improves relevant experience? What cadence and content of lifecycle messaging drives engagement?

The measurement and attribution infrastructure enables good decision-making. How do we track users across the entire journey from first touch through conversion to retention? What attribution model do we use for multi-touch journeys? How do we measure incrementality for different channels and campaigns? What cohort analysis and retention metrics guide decisions? For AI products specifically, how do we connect product usage quality with business outcomes?

**Customer Lifecycle and Retention**

Acquiring customers is expensive. Keeping them is crucial for sustainable economics. Help me develop strategies that maximize customer lifetime value through retention and expansion.

The customer success function ensures users achieve outcomes and derive value. What does the customer success motion look like across different customer segments? How do we identify accounts at risk of churn early enough to intervene? What playbooks guide customer success interactions? How do we scale customer success economically across usage tiers? What self-service resources reduce need for high-touch success? How does customer feedback flow into product priorities?

The churn analysis and intervention strategy addresses why customers leave and what to do about it. What are the leading indicators of churn risk? What causes are addressable through product improvements versus customer success intervention versus accepting as normal churn? How do we segment churn to focus efforts on highest-value retention? What win-back strategies exist for churned customers? For AI products, does churn relate to accuracy, reliability, ease of use, or value perception?

Expansion and upsell motions drive revenue growth from existing customers. What triggers indicate readiness for expansion such as usage patterns, team growth, or specific behaviors? How do we identify and prioritize expansion opportunities? What is the process for presenting and closing upsells? How do we design pricing and packaging to create clear upgrade paths? What product hooks encourage expansion through capacity limits, premium features, or additional capabilities?

**Growth Team and Capabilities**

Effective growth requires building the right team structure and capabilities. Help me think through organizational design for growth.

The growth team structure needs clarity on roles, ownership, and collaboration. Do we need a dedicated growth team, or does growth happen across product, marketing, and sales? What skills are required including growth product management, growth engineering, data analysis, performance marketing, lifecycle marketing, and customer success? How do growth, product, and engineering collaborate? What authority does the growth function have versus influence?

The data and analytics infrastructure powers growth decisions. What data pipeline and warehousing supports growth analytics? What business intelligence tools enable self-service analysis? What data quality and governance practices ensure trustworthy insights? How do we democratize data access while maintaining governance? What specialized analytics capabilities do we need for experimentation, cohort analysis, and attribution?

The marketing technology stack enables execution and optimization. What tools do we need for marketing automation, ad management, SEO and content optimization, conversion rate optimization, customer data platform, and analytics? How do we evaluate and integrate new tools? What is our philosophy on best-of-breed versus platform approaches? How do we manage technical debt and tool sprawl?

**Unit Economics and Financial Sustainability**

Growth must be economically sustainable. Help me model and optimize unit economics to ensure profitable growth.

The core economics framework breaks down customer lifetime value and customer acquisition cost. What is average revenue per user across different segments and tiers? What are retention curves and churn rates? What are gross margins after infrastructure costs for AI products? This gives us LTV. Then for CAC, what does it cost to acquire a customer across different channels? What is the sales and marketing burden? What is the LTV to CAC ratio, and what should it be? How long is the payback period for acquiring a customer?

The business model optimization identifies leverage points for improving economics. How can we increase LTV through pricing optimization, driving more usage, improving retention, or enabling expansion? How can we reduce CAC through channel optimization, improving conversion rates, or leveraging product-led growth? For AI products specifically, how do infrastructure costs scale with usage, and where can we optimize?

The growth investment strategy balances current profitability with growth investment. What growth rate are we targeting? What level of investment in sales and marketing does this require? How do we balance cash flow versus growth? When does growth need to become profitable? What metrics guide the growth investment decision?

**International and Market Expansion**

Growing into new markets or geographies creates new opportunities and challenges. Help me think through expansion strategy.

The market selection framework prioritizes which markets to enter. What markets have similar customer needs and dynamics to our core market? Where can we leverage existing capabilities versus needing to build new ones? What is market size, competitive intensity, and regulatory environment? What are language, currency, and payment requirements? For AI products, what are data residency or AI regulation requirements?

The market entry strategy determines how we approach new markets. Do we launch with full capabilities or a wedge offering? Do we rely on self-serve adoption, local partners, or direct sales? What adaptations to product, pricing, or messaging are required? How do we sequence entry to multiple markets? What success criteria determine whether to expand or double down?

The localization and adaptation covers product, content, and operations. What language support is required in product and marketing? What payment methods and currencies do we need? What local compliance or certification requirements exist? How do we provide support across time zones? What cultural adaptations improve relevance?

**Long-Term Growth Moats and Defensibility**

Sustainable growth requires building defensible advantages. Help me think about long-term competitive moats.

Network effects grow value with scale. Does our product get better as more users adopt it? How can we strengthen network effects through community, marketplace dynamics, or data effects? For AI products, does more usage create better training data that improves the model in a virtuous cycle?

Brand and category leadership create preference and pricing power. How do we build strong brand recognition and trust? Can we define or own a category? What content marketing, thought leadership, or PR builds category leadership? For AI products, how do we build trust in accuracy, reliability, and responsible AI?

The switching costs and lock-in through integrations, workflows, or data accumulation discourage churn. How embedded does our product become in customer workflows? What proprietary data or learning does using our product create? What would customers lose by switching? How do we balance lock-in with customer friendliness?

**Growth Roadmap and Milestones**

Help me create a phased growth roadmap with clear milestones and dependencies.

For the near term covering the next three to six months, what are the highest priority growth initiatives? What experiments should we run? What capabilities need to be built? What are specific targets for acquisition, activation, and retention? What early wins build momentum?

The medium term covering six to eighteen months extends the vision. What channels become major growth drivers? What new markets or segments open up? What product enhancements unlock growth? What scale of growth team and capabilities do we build? Where should we be in terms of key metrics?

The long term covering eighteen months to three years articulates the ultimate vision. What does sustainable growth at scale look like? How do different growth motions mature? What competitive moats have we built? What does the organization look like? Where are we in the market?

## Tips for Best Results

Growth is a discipline that combines art and science. The science is rigorous measurement, experimentation, and data-driven optimization. The art is creative hypotheses, compelling positioning, and building emotional connections with customers. Balance both for sustainable growth.

Focus is crucial when resources are limited. Many struggling growth efforts result from spreading efforts too thin across too many channels and tactics. Better to dominate a few channels than be mediocre at many. Pick your battles and double down on what's working.

Remember that the best growth hacks are useless if the product doesn't deliver value. The foundation of all sustainable growth is product-market fit where customers love what you've built enough to keep using it and tell others. Don't neglect product quality and experience in pursuit of growth metrics.

Growth strategies evolve as you scale. What works to get your first thousand customers often doesn't scale to a million. Plan for transitions across different scale phases and build the capabilities needed for each phase before you need them.

Learn from both successes and failures. Every experiment teaches something whether it succeeds or fails. Build an organizational practice of sharing learnings, documenting what worked and what didn't, and building institutional knowledge about your unique growth dynamics.

**Remember**: Growth is not a single tactic but a system of capabilities, processes, and disciplines that compound over time. Use this framework to build a comprehensive, sustainable growth engine rather than chasing short-term wins that don't build toward lasting competitive advantage.
